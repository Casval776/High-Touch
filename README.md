# High-Touch

In this challenge you’ll be writing a simple to-do list application with a twist.  Since you would be working with React and TypeScript as part of the Nigel team, we ask that you do the same for your challenge. 
Here’s the requirements: 

* Build a simple Trello board knockoff using React and TypeScript.  It doesn't have to look perfect, focus more on making it functional. 

* * The board should have at a minimum 3 hard coded columns for holding the to-do cards. 

* * * TODO 

* * * IN-PROGRESS 

* * * DONE 

* * The cards can be very basic but should capture the text of what needs to be accomplished. 

* * There needs to be a button someplace for adding new cards to the board. 

* * The user should be able to transition the cards between the 3 columns. 

* * * How this is done is up to you. 

* * How you handle the state of the application is completely up to you.   

* * * Since this is a front-end only application, we don’t expect that the app state will survive a restart of the application. 

* * We should be able to easily run the application locally on our laptop using a script in package.json. 

* * Provide instructions on how the app works and how we can run it. 

* * Feel free to add anything you think would make the application better.
